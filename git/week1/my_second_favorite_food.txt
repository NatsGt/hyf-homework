Guatemalan platains

• 4 (yellow) ripe plantains
• 1 cinnamon stick
• 1 can of black refried beans
• Vegetable oil
• 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder
• 4 teaspoons of sugar
• water

• Wash the plantains. Cut off the ends of the plantains and discard. Cut the rest of the plantains into 4 parts leaving the skin on.
• Heat a medium pot filled with water, leaving enough room to add the plantains.
• Bring water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons of sugar, cinnamon and the plantains.
• Reduce the heat and cook for about 10 minutes or until the plantain is cooked and feels soft. Make sure not to overcook it as you don’t want it falling apart.
• Drain the plantains saving the plantain water.
• Peel the plantains and remove the vein with the black seeds.
• Mash them into a smooth paste making sure there are no lumps. Let it cool.
• In a pan, cook the refried beans, 2 tablespoons of water and 2 tablespoons of sugar. Mix well until they form a soft paste.
• Heat sufficient oil in a large frying pan.
• Take a lime sized ball of plantain paste and flatten it in your hand. Then form a little bowl.
• Add one teaspoon of the chocolate/bean mixture and close the bowl so it forms an egg shaped ball with the chocolate/bean mixture inside. Make sure there are no holes or gaps so the filling cannot leak out.
• Fry the stuffed plantains until they have a light golden-brown color, turning them a few times so they are uniformly cooked.
• Sprinkle with additional sugar before serving.
• You can serve them with sour cream or with additional bean/chocolate sauce.
• To make the bean chocolate sauce just add a bit more water to the bean/chocolate paste until it reaches the desired consistency.
