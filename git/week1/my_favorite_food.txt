Guatemalan Chilaquilas Recipe

• 6 tablespoons oil, divided
• 6-6 inch corn tortillas (I bought mine fresh at a Mexican grocery store but you can use Olé or similar)
• 6 eggs
• ½ pund of Oaxaca cheese

• Add 4 tablespoons of cooking oil to a large sauté pan and heat over medium flame until hot.
• Wrap tortillas in damp towel and heat in the microwave for 30 seconds.
• Beat eggs in a medium bowl until thickened, 3-5 minutes.
• Slice the cheese into ¼ inch thick pieces.
• Take a tortilla and place a slice of each cheese to one side of it and fold other half of tortilla over it.
• Dip tortilla wrapped cheese in the eggs, one by one. Make sure that some of the egg gets inside. 
• Slightly scoop the tortilla out of the bowl so that some egg is scooped up and place in the pan.
• Cook until both sides of Chilaquilas are golden brown, about 5 minutes each side.
